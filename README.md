# BasicTradingBot
Basic trading bot using quantconnect
I used quantconnect to write/test the code. The program was made in python. In this code I took API's for
certain stocks, analyzed the data and took what I needed to create a trading bot that changes on its own.
Refer to image 1 for an almost 2 year trading of the bot on $TSLA and refer to image 2 for a one month trading
to show the functionality of riding profits works as the equity increase whilst the net profit stayed at 0 as it had not yet sold
due to it recognizing how to ride the wave.
